# Instructent
(WIP) A Meteor webapp that allows instructors to quickly and easily create documents, quizzes, or assignments and share them with students using a simple access token.

This is definitely a work in progress, and I can't say for sure that it'll run on anybody else's machine but mine.

##To run

1. If you don't already have it, [get Meteor.](https://www.meteor.com/install) It's shiny!
2. Clone/download this repository.
3. Execute `meteor run` from the root directory.
4. Lemme know how it goes.

##Things of note

1. Theoretically, you can log in to the instructor section with username `instructor` or `admin`, and password `pass123` (don't tell my password to anybody though, plz).
